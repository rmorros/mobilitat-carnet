# Artificial vision for kick-scooter

## Introduction

In the last years, vehicle technology has started incorporating different types of sensors to
increase safety. to regulate daily traffic and monitor the dangers that may arise in a driver
during his day to day life. In this project, we propose a system to reinforce safety by using
affordable cameras that capture the different elements that make up a driver’s environment
and could warn him of something. The proposed method will be based on computer vision
and Artificial Intelligence, more specifically, deep learning methods.

## Goal:

The project consists of a computer vision analysis of the conditions of the circulation of micromobility vehicles (bicycles and personal mobility vehicles or VMPs). This analysis is used to determine the conditions of the road, the presence of static or dynamic obstacles that could pose a danger to the drivers of these vehicles or to pedestrians.

## Projects:

The project currently does contains two modules, which have been developed independently:
  - [DETECTION OF STATIC AND DYNAMIC OBJECTS](/DynamicStaticHazards)
  - [LANE RECOGNITION](/TypeOfRoad)
  
 Moreover, it also contains a tool integrally developed by our team which was used for the annotation of the videos:
  - [ANNOTATION TOOL](/AnnotationTool)
  
  All the information for both modules can be find inside each directory.
