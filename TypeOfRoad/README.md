# MicroMobility - Carnet

## Goal:

The project consists of a computer vision analysis of the conditions of the circulation of micromobility vehicles (bicycles and personal mobility vehicles or VMPs). This analysis is used to determine the conditions of the road, the presence of static or dynamic obstacles that could pose a danger to the drivers of these vehicles or to pedestrians.
