# AnntotationTool
AnnotationTool is a mini-project created to easy annotating videos for Computer Vision Training and Evaluation

Our AnnotationTool is based on Python language and is very simple but useful. Basically it involves 2 scripts, each of one has different aims while annoting.

 ### Frame Identification
 "Frame Identification" relies on the important aspect that sometimes, when we are detecting and tracking objects in videos, we want to make sure that the object is detected approximately on first appearence, and mark as disappeared as soon as it goes off the image.
 
 ### Category Identification
 "Category Identification" is simplier. The main objective of this script is to annotate the number of each type of object detected in a whole video. Therefore, we set some classes in a txt file and , through a button pressing menu, we can count all objects that appear in real time on the video.

 ### Installation
 All modules set in the requirements.txt file contain the exact version when the scripts were created. Updating should not suppose any problem but we cannot guarantee the best operation.
 > pip install requirements.txt
